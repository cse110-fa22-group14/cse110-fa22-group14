# How are the data going to be stores in our app?

## Context and Problem Statement

Since this is a CRUD app, we must also consider the possible ways of storing data the users put in. Are there any specific tools we should be exploring at this point?

## Considered Options

* Database tools
* JSON objects

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "JSON objects" This seems more relevant to the scope of this project. Implementing Databases can be difficult within a short amount of time.
