# What is the age demographics of our users?

## Context and Problem Statement

This will better help us in the creation of the user personas.

## Considered Options

* Consider all ages
* 16+
* 18-30
* Everyone who drinks coffee, but at least graduated from middle school.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Focus on the people who drink coffee instead, because we will not be including any age-sensitive contents in our product.
