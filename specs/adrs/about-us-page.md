# What to include in our aboutus page?

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to make the about us page a good way for the users to have a valid contact with our developing team. And we also wish users are able to know better about the theme of this app. 

## Considered Options

* Have a team video that talks about this project
* Have individual introduction video
* Have a mission statement and brief team introduction


## Decision Outcome

Finally we decide not to use any video. The first reason is that users may not be interested in listening to the technical stuffs or information about the individual in our developing team. Moreover, when we have to make this decision, the time was really limited. Considering we want to allocate more time on polishing the main features we decided not to shoot the video. Eventually, we have why to use brewnotes, mission statements, and a map of UCSD computer science and engineering building as our location, since we always had group meeting there.
