# What is our users' favorite social media app?

## Context and Problem Statement

It will be easier to understand the behavior of our users based on their preference on interacting with others in the digital world.

## Considered Options

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Instagram
* Reddit
* Discord

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Instagram" Our users are those that are interested in sharing food and drinks on their social media. Many people take pictures of their food and post them on Instagram, so these people are more likely to be our target audiences.
