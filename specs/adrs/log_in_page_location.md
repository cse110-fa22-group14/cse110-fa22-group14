# Where should the log in/sign up page be?

## Context and Problem Statement

Do we need a specific page for the access/creation of the users' accounts, or do we embed that in the home screen?

## Considered Options

* Create an independent screen for log in and sign up
* Embed that into the home screen
* Both

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Embed that into the home screen" This will be the easiest for the users to access without having to load a separate page.
