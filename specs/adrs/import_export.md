# How can we make our app collaborative?

## Context and Problem Statement

Since we want to make our APP collaborative, we wish users can share their coffee cards and read others' coffee cards. However, there doesn't seem to have an easy way to do so.

## Considered Options

* Database tools
* JSON objects
* Input and export files from web applications

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Input and export files from web applications" This seems simple and straightforward to satisfy our goals.
