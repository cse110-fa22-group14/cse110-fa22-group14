# What are the information users want to keep track of in our app?

## Context and Problem Statement

One of the main purpose of a CRUD app is to store information produced by the users.
We need to understand the needs of our users to better frame our product.

## Considered Options

* Name and brand for each drink.
* Location of where the drink was obtained
* Price of the drink
* The different flavors of the drink
* Color of the drink
* How the drink was made
* Allow the users to determine what specific type of information they want to store.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: All of the above. Users might find value in utilizing each one of these pieces of information. It might be difficult to offer options to the users to customize the interface of the app, so it is not considered currently.
