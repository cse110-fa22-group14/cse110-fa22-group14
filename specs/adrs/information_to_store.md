# What are the information users want to keep track of in our app?

## Context and Problem Statement

One of the main purpose of a CRUD app is to store information produced by the users.
We need to understand the needs of our users to better frame our product.

## Considered Options

* Name and brand for each drink.
* Allow the users to determine what specific type of information they want to store.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Name and brand for each drink." It might be difficult to offer options to the users to customize the interface of the app, so it is not considered currently.
