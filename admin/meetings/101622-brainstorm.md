### Decisions Made
-----------------------
- Decided on a logo for ProForce through a Zoom poll. Slack workspace picture has been updated to reflect new logo
- Decided on the values and culture for ProForce. Team.md file has been updated to reflect the new values
  - The values of the company revolve around inclusivity, supportive, a sense of comradery, group alignment, curiosity, creativity, committing to the learning process


- No decisions have been made regarding the project ProForce wants to work on for the quarter. The team leads asked the group to share what project they would want to work on that meets the constraints. The following ideas were shared
  - A shopping list app that lets you make a shopping list and update the list, adding and removing items if you bought them already. The app will then report on the user's shopping trends
  - Based on the idea of filling out physical coffee tasting sheets for specific types of coffee, make software that allows users to digitally complete a coffee tasting sheet with a final review for coffee and maybe allow the user to share these reviews on their social media
  - Based on how hard and time-consuming it can be for students to find educational resources for classes, make software that allows people to form groups and communicate with each other sharing these resources that they may have obtained easily. This idea can easily integrate social media into its functionality.
  - Rate music software, but instead of rating music, rate movies. Similarly, rate YouTube videos on a system other than like/dislike (5 stars)
- Originally the plan was to combine aspects of these project ideas together to create a project the group could work on. However, these domains are not similar enough for a simple combination. 
- The group suggested features could be combined to create the final project, however Antonio jumped in and brought up the point that this can lead to feature bloat
- Based on this discussion, the best way forward might be to focus on working in a single domain. No conclusion was reached though.
