### Decisions Made
-----------------------
- The team will be employing the buddy system to increase the bus factor
- Meetings will be recorded and distributed for later replay
  - All tasks on the project will at least be assigned two people, where one is the lead, the other will keep up with what is happening with this task. This is task dependent, as both/all members may need to take a more active role in task
- For the team video, we decided on following a "pass the phone" format
  - potential options were comic style video, meme intro, pass the phone, professional video
  - After distributing a poll, 5/8 attendants wanted to make a pass the phone format, 3/8 attendants wanted to make a comic style format. The person who hosted Zoom meeting could not vote on the poll
- For the video, everyone will have a segment where they introduce themselves, and then pass the phone from right to left
-  The logo for ProForce will be a cube with a p and f on its sides. Designs are in the Slack channel
