### Agenda and Meeting Notes
-----------------------
- Zhaoyu Zhang
  - Welcome and greet everyone at the meeting
  - Initiate discussion for people to go around and list one thing you think can be applied from the Shape Up book to this meeting or project
    - Antonio: fat-marker sketches -> way to plan out program without getting into UI details
    - Ryan: Keep in mind what should/shouldnâ€™t be in our scope of the project
    - Henry: Minimizing the unknown risk from using new tools or technology -> Using tools that we are already familiar with.
    - Gnamitha: Make sure to write out the pitch with the following template: Problem, Appetite, Solution, Rabbit Holes, No-Gos
    - Ruilin: Find out in what circumstances our ideas can be useful.
    - Zhaoyu: Small group to decide core features 
    - William: Avoid grab-bags. Productive proposals with direction and clarity, this will be good for defining features to add/remove
  - Define what a coffee card is (e.g. looking at examples of coffee cards, how they are filled out)
  - Ask everyone the question of who the users of our app will be, and their personas
  - Initiate team discussion about prompt: Given that we have 4 weeks to produce the software, what are non-negotiable features we must add, what are features we can omit?
    - Think about how important this feature actually is in the grand scheme of our problem, and if we want to put in the time/effort
- Jose Salazar
  - (Using either breadboard or fat-marker sketch) Initiate team discussion about prompt: What is the flow of our interface? This sets up the key "elements" that should be in the software
    - If a user just downloaded the app, how do they make their first coffee card? What are the steps they take in the app? 
    - Similarly, if they already made 1 coffee card, but want to make another one, what are the steps they take? What does the UI do?
  - Initiate team discussion about prompt: What are the risks and rabbit holes? Are there things we didn't account for?
    - Put on your CS hats for a second, and think if any aspect of what we have decided to include might be challenging to implement?
    - Is there a potentially simple enough way(s) to visually layout all of these elements? 
      - There may be multiple good approaches, but as long as we can think of one, we are in the clear. 
      - Otherwise, discussion is needed on the element that is making the design inconsistent to create a basic fix or omit
  - Initiate team discussion about prompt: Is there any functionality we will never include, period?
- Zhaoyu Zhang
  - Initiate team discussion about prompt: Final check, considering the constraints of our project (local first, etc), is it possible for us to build everything we decided on?
  - Ask everyone to fill out a when2meet again to find new times to meet
    - Plan on having smaller in-person meetings to increase morale and efficiency of meetings
