### Name: Ruilin Hu

Hi everyone, I am Ruilin Hu and it is my third year into Computer Engineering. I recently got into SystemVerilog, and I am exploring what I can do with the tools at hand. Please don't hesitate to let me know about anything you have in mind about SV or any that's programming-related.

### Name: Jose Salazar

Hi, I'm Jose Salazar and it's my 4th year at UCSD, studying Computer Science and Pure Math. I am interested in the more theoretical aspects of Computer Science, but I can appreciate a really cool application when I see one! I like to play the violin on the side when I'm not studying.

### Name: Antonio Anguiano
Hello my name is Antonio and I'm a third year Computer Science major. My interest is mostly in web development at the moment, but I think of it more so as just one practical application of cs. In my free time I also play the viola (it's like a slightly bigger violin) and just  listen to a lot of music in general.
