### 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

All members will be expected to read Slack messages from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than **12 hours** unless there is an emergency.

### 3) Scheduling Meetings

Meetings will be regularly scheduled by the team leads on a weekly basis at a time that is most convienent for all team members. A Google Calendar Event will be sent out to all members with details of the meeting at least 3 days before it is scheduled to take place. If any emergency meetings are to be scheduled, these meetings must be communicated to team members at least 12 hours in advance. If a person on the team wants to schedule an additional meeting during the week, they are to raise this concern to the team leads, who then have the final decision of scheduling said meeting. 

#### 4) General Responsibilities for all Team Members

- To behave professionally toward other group members and course staff
- To respect and listen to the other team members
- Have patience, compassion, and understanding for others throughout the project
- To complete assigned responsibilities for the project in a timely fashion, and to "pull their weight" with the project
- To keep other members updated of the work they are doing
- To keep an open line of communication with the course staff and members of the group. _Let the team leads or course staff know if any issues arise, as soon as they arise_
- Write descriptive documentation for all aspects of your contributions (i.e. the code you write, pull requests, issues) with precise English



#### 5) Conflict Resolution

If a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to reach out to this team member and communicate to keep the team member accountable in a respectful manner. If no one can establish contact with the team member after 2 days, the team will hold a majority vote to determine what to do with the responsibility of the unresponsive team member. There will be two options:
- Redistribute roles so that another member, who was designated as the auxilliary member can help complete the task assigned to the unresponsive team member
- Omit completing the task and save it for a future deadline, or drop the task altogether from the project

#### 6) Expectations of TAs and Instructor

**If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the course staff, _but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment_. The course staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.**
